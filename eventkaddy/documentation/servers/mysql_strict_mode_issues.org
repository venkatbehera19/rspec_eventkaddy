#+TITLE: MySql Strict Mode

* Explanation
Mysql 5.7 has several default sql_mode settings including ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY. We have code in the mobile site and cms that violates this setting. The approach to date has been to remove the setting rather than fix the code. 

*Steps to Resolve the error
1. Determine which server hosts the database. Sometimes it is the same as the server that host the code, but usually not.
2. Open the mysql console mysql -u ekuser -p, and type SELECT @@sql_mode. If you see "ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY" in the list, then this is what is causing the issue. 
3. Add a file to /etc/mysql/conf.d/ that has these lines: 
[mysqld]

sql_mode = "STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"

4. Restart mysql: sudo service mysql restart
