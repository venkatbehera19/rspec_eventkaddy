#+TITLE: Setting Drupal to Maintenance Mode

* Explanation

Sometimes it is neccessary to take the drupal site offline. We did this recently in response to a hacker attack on the Defcon site. We use Drush to handle this. Drush is a shell-based application used to control, manipulate, and administer Drupal sites. 

* Steps
1. Login to the drupal server - deploy@173.230.151.29, pw hint: BG!23
2. Navigate to the folder sourceofknowledge.com from the home directory
3. Run this command 'drush vset maintenance_mode 1'. 
4. To turn it off, simply run 'drush vset maintenance_mode 0'
