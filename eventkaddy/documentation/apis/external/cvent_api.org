#+TITLE: Working with the Cvent API

* Adding a New Integration for Cvent

This is used for fep, fiserv and bcbs attendees

1. Navigate to olympus-cms.eventkaddy.com/dev and select "Manage Scripts". Then select "Add Button From Template". Add a script and view it in the scripts view. 
2. Locally, choose the latest import script from the same client, and duplicate it and rename it. 
3. Add the filename to the script button you just created, then export the database and import it locally. 
4. Review your newly created import script. Near the bottom will be a url to 'https://bcbsproxyb.eventkaddy.net/{unique-event-endpoint}?proxy-key={proxy-key}'. Edit the unique event url part to match the new event name. 
5. Login to Mercury (50.116.38.36) and navigate to home/deploy/ek-bcbsproxyb/. Select the file that corresponds to the current year e.g. app-bcbs2019.rb 
6. Duplicate an endpoint from the same client, updating the endpoint url and ecode - found in the line that looks like: registrants = Cvent::Registration.find_for_event(...). If there is not an existing client, you will need to ask for the credentials, they are referenced in the line that looks like: Cvent::Client.instance.load_config(...). Then restart the server sudo /etc/init.d/thin-ekbcbsproxyb restart
8. Start testing your script. Publish your script in the scripts view and run it. I review the data for capitalization problems and missing fields. If data is missing and not available in the json, see the next section. 

* Viewing Raw CVENT Data to find a Missing Field

We do this occassionally to look for missing fields or look at the structure of the data. Cvent returns SOAP data rather than json, making it more difficult to read. 

1. Delete the log files: cd ekbcbsproxy-b sudo rm -r log. I usually do this so that I can be sure the input I am seeing is from the integration I am testing, rather than another integration.
2. Turn on logging in vendor/cvent-ruby/lib/cvent/client.rb, lines 20/21 and comment out line 52. This is usually set to false as there is a lot of logging data. 
3. Restart server sudo /etc/init.d/thin-ekbcbsproxyb restart. This is necessary for logging to be turned on.
4. Hit the endpoint from localhost, or directly in the browser.
5. Check all the log files, the output will only be in one - e.g. tail -n 1000 thin.ekbcbsproxyb.3.log
6. Search output for the field you are looking for. 
7. In some cases we need to update the survey_detail file, as these questions frequently change. Identify the question id e.g. F0C11F01-9945-4D12-AC1E-34A8C90B48C1 and then update the file vendor/cvent-ruby/lib/cvent/survey_detail.rb which is called from vendor/cvent-ruby/lib/cvent/registration.rb
8. Turn off logging and restart the server
