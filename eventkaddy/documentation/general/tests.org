#+TITLE: Tests
* A Note About Our Tests
Up until Feb 5 2018 our tests were just the autogenerated fixtures from rails generate commands. rake test would not even run because some of the fixtures were for tables that did not exist, which would cause an error when ActiveSupport tried to clean the table.

Therefore much of the application is untested, and as of writing only a few tests have been added.

Inexplicably, even after commenting out all tests but one, there are still 31 of them when I run the command. None if I comment out that last test. Probably rails is automatically testing something about every table, matching columns maybe.
