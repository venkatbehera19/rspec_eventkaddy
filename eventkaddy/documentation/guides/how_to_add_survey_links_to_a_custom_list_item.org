#+TITLE: How to Add Survey Links To A Custom List Item

* Step 1
Create surveys.
* Step 2
Using ids from the surveys, add links to the custom_list_item content with the following special string. Very similar to adding a ce certificate button.

#+NAME: special string
#+BEGIN_SRC
==Survey^^{survey_id}^^{button text}==
#+END_SRC

Ex:

#+NAME: special string
#+BEGIN_SRC
==Survey^^261^^global poll 2==
#+END_SRC

The user will be returned to the custom list item after submitting the survey (using backOneLocation()).

* Optional

surveys have a post_action column, which can have a value "EmailCredits^^Nameofcertificate" in order to email a certificate before returning to the custom list item. This is not the value of the custom_list_item.content.

Ex:

EmailCredits^^Certificate_Of_Completion
