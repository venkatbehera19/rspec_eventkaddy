<%# I may still use this, but for now I'm testing in the regular form %>
<%# Update: We're just using a regular multiselect for this purpose. As I thought %>
<%# about what was required for this task and what I had been thinking about before %>
<%# this specific task, I realised they weren't the same. So we're using edit_tags %>
