Instructions for manual patching

#manually delete .svn directories if necessary, or use svn export if possible
find . -type d -name '.svn' -exec rm {} \;

#create the diff (with context option enabled) changes in a patch for the two directories
diff -rc ./www-old/ ./www-new/ > manualchanges.patch

#in the directory level above the working copy to be patched, run the patch
patch -p0 -i ./manualchanges.patch 



merge algorithm:

	A bit of shell script using grep should do it, the general process is this:
	
	assume your 2 files are file1 and file2
	
	Copy file1 to outfile
	
	for each line file2
	
	if grep for line in outfile produces no results
	
	append the line to the end of outfile
	
	endif
	
	next line in file2
