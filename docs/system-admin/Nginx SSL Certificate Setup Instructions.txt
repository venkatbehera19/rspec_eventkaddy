Nginx SSL Certificate Setup Instructions

	Look for the two lines in /opt/nginx/nginx.conf that indicate the certificate information location:

	    ssl_certificate      /srv/ssl/eventkaddy.net.crt;
	    ssl_certificate_key  /srv/ssl/eventkaddy.net.key;



	Each year upon renewal GoDaddy sends us a new certificate and the gd_bundle.crt file.

		ex.  XXXXXXXXXXX.crt  #our new certificate

	They use the same (or at least did in 2014) gd_bundle.crt as the year before.

	Unzip the GoDaddy files in a temp directory.

	For Nginx the gd_bundle file needed to be appended to the .crt file:

		cat gd_bundle.crt >> 2b7be9ae261941.crt

	Make a copy of last year's certificate file just in case the new one fails:

		cp /srv/ssl/eventkaddy.net.crt /srv/ssl/eventkaddy.net.crt_2013

	Then rename and simultaneously replace the old certificate:

		sudo cp ./2b7be9ae261941.crt /srv/ssl/eventkaddy.net.crt

	Reboot Nginx and verify the new certificate is working by browsing to one of our sites using SSL
	You may have to clear out browser data caches to get the certificate to refresh.
