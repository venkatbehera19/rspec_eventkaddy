SVN TO GIT PATCHING TECHNIQUE

Found that using svn diff to generate patch file and then using patch command or git apply in
git repo produced errors.

This technique worked:

Use the linux diff command between two separate svn checkouts
	-exclude .svn directories
	-use the -u for 3 lines of unified context
	-recursive

diff -ru --exclude=.svn eventkaddy-rev1040 ek-wvc2014-speaker-portal > ekpatch.diff

then, cd into relevant git sub-directory and patch at that sublevel, in this case p1 (ignoring top-level directory names)

patch -p1 -i ../../ekpatch.diff
