DEPLOY TO ANDROID MARKET

http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/16494773/Getting%20Ready%20to%20Deploy%20to%20Android%20Market%20(Android)


These instructions assume that you are using an Eclipse-based IDE to develop your PhoneGap application.
Rename the project in Eclipse
Rename the package:

Change the Android Manifest. You should remove features that you are not using if possible. The only two that need to remain are READ_PHONE_STATE and INTERNET if you are only using it for the web. Also, remember to change the package, versionCode and versionName since these appear on the Android Market.
Fix Reference Errors if they occur by deleting the line that is highlighted in the Java files. (Eclipse autogenerates references)
Change the name of the app in res/values/strings.xml
Right click on the package, go to Android Tools, Export Signed Application Package

Create a keystore. Remember where this keystore is!
Follow the wizard and sign the application.
Once the apk has been exported, please remember to deploy it to the Android Market.
